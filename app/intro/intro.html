        My dream is to build a machine that can learn and interpret the physical world without any human intervention. Therefore, my interest spans over a broad spectrum of <b>Machine Learning</b> &#38; <b>Computer Vision</b>. I want to discover the secrets behind our own intelligence; I wish to know if "intelligence" is really so special and where humans stand in this universe.
